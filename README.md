A generalized model that used the data from UCI machine learning repository to predict if a person has donated blood or not. 
This consists of features like recency, frequency, c.c of blood donated, time and predicts a binary output.
This is trained by Logistic Regression Algorithm using various libraries like pandas, keras etc.
The last part of code is not working due to some dimension errors that I'll try to fix soon. EDIT: The graph is npw working but I'm not getting the plot.
The Neural_Net_tf file does the same predictions using the Neural Nets algorithm using help of tensorflow estimators. The features name may vary from dataset in this code, kindly change it.
Scikit learn PREDICTION to be added soon.
